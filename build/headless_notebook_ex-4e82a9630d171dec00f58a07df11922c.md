# Run a Parameterized Notebook with Headless Execution

**What you’ll accomplish:** Prepare a parameterized notebook, execute it through an API request, and inspect the resulting job.  
**Applications used:** [JupyterLab](../../applications/jupyterlab.md), [Headless Execution](../../applications/headless_execution.md)  
**Estimated time:** 20–30 minutes  
**Before you start:** You need a working notebook, access to the Workspace shared folder, and a Workspace where Headless Execution is enabled. Basic familiarity with API requests or `curl` is helpful.  


Learn how to leverage headless notebooks to run your Jupyter notebooks with dynamic parameters. This guide walks you through starting a server, executing a notebook, and managing job outputs for automated analysis.

1\. Navigate to your workspace - this tutorial is shown on a specific workspace but can be reproduced anywhere where this application is enabled

\
2\. Click "Headless Notebook" to verify that the application is enabled. If this icon is missing, please contact our support or your workspace administrator to add it

\
3\. Now let's start JupyterLab to prepare your notebook

\
4\. For the pygeoapi worker to find the correct notebook, it needs to be created in a specific structure within a shared folder. Inside the **shared** **folder**, there is another **folder** **named** **the** **same** **as** **the workspace** - this is the correct location.\
The shared folder is shared among all users in the workspace and also with pygeoapi. \
\
Inside this folder, the structure can be arbitrary - separated into many other folders or just single notebooks.

\
5\. Open a notebook and write your code into the cells

\
6\. The cell that should take input parameters from the headless call needs to be adjusted, and the parameters (variables) with default values need to be explicitly assigned.

\
7\. In addition to explicitly setting default parameters, the cells containing them need to be tagged "parameters". Save the notebook once you are done.

\
8\. To trigger the **headless execution**, you need to send a request to a specific endpoint. \
Inside the call you can specify:\
- a specific **kernel** (if not specified, it will automatically use the same kernel which was saved with the notebook), the input should be the **full kernel name**\
- **parameters** to be overwritten by the execution\
- **full path** to the notebook \
\
Optionally, it is possible to include resource limits, like CPU or RAM.\
\
This request can be sent via any application the user prefers, not just a direct curl call.\
\
Here is an **example** call using curl:\
\
curl --include \\ \
--request POST 'https://pygeoapi-eoxhub.{your-workspace-url}/processes/execute-notebook/jobs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{\
"inputs":{\
"notebook":"/home/jovyan/.shared/{your-workspace-url}/{your-notebook-name}.ipynb",\
"kernel": "{full-kernel-name}",\
"parameters_json":{\
"a": "1",\
"b": "2"\
}\
}\
}'

\
9\. Executed notebooks and their results can be found in the sub-folder **job-output**, in the same location as the originating notebooks.\
All cells will be executed, so opening the notebook can be used for debugging purposes.

\
10\. In the "**Headless Notebook**" application, you can track the progress of the running jobs and explore details like the parameters used and running time.

\
11\. By clicking "Browse jobs," you can browse all the headless jobs in the workspace.

\
13\. By clicking on the Job-ID, you can access the details.

\
14\. Opening the desired job details will show the passed parameters of the call, including the **kernel** and the exact values of the **parameters**. This helps with the reproducibility and traceability of the executed algorithms.
