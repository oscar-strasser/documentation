# Container Registry

We use **Zot Registry** — a lightweight, OCI-native container image registry — as a repository for storing and managing container images within EOxHub Workspaces.
You can easily push your custom images to Zot and pull them directly into your **Argo Workflows**.

The login credentials can be found in the secret **registry-login** in the [credentials manager](./secret_manager.md) of your workspace.

```{figure} assets/credentials-manager/registry-credentials-detail.png
---
name: registry-credentials-detail
---
Credential 'registry-login' contains the login information for the container registry: registry server FQDN (URL), username & password
```

### Upload images to registry

Authenticate with the endpoint and push your locally built images using standard tools like Docker or Podman, e.g.:

1. Login
    ```shell
    docker login -u <username> registry.[workspace-name].[cluster].eox.at
    # Type in the password when asked.  
    ```

2. Tag your image
    ```shell
    docker tag my-image:latest registry.[workspace-name].[cluster].eox.at/my-image:latest
    ```
   
3. Push the image to the registry

    ```shell
    docker push registry.[workspace-name].[cluster].eox.at/my-image:latest
    ```

After a successful upload, the image is visible in the UI and in the file browser.

### Reference in Argo
Update your Argo Workflow templates to point to the Zot registry URL in your `container` or `script` definitions.
