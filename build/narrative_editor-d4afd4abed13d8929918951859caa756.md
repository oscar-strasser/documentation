# Narrative Editor

The **Narrative Editor** is a content editor for creating and publishing structured narratives combined with Earth Observation (EO) content. This documentation provides an overview of its architecture, key features, and functionality.

## Overview
The Narrative Editor is based on the [storytelling EOXElement](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/story/elements-eox-storytelling--markdown-with-editor) and includes a preview renderer that uses Markdown text along with additional metadata (frontmatter) to define story settings and structure.

It integrates:

* A Git-based workflow using git-clerk for content versioning and collaboration
* Scrollytelling and paginated rendering of narratives — where content can be presented either as a continuous scrolling story or divided into discrete pages or sections for a step-by-step reading experience
* Live preview for story validation
* Support for interactive map tours

## Key Features

### Git-Based Editing

* Users connect their EOxHub account to GitHub.
* Editing an existing narrative creates forks or branches.
* Users can request reviews through pull requests in GitHub.

### Story Rendering

* Live preview of changes as they are made.
* Supports both paginated and scroll-style rendering.

### Map Integration

* Supports `eox-map` [EOxElement blocks](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-eox-map--docs).
* Provides a polished experience with seamless transitions and animations between map tour steps.
* Compatible with the [EO Dashboard scrollytelling configuration](https://eodash.org/storytelling.html).

## Technical Details

The Narrative Editor provides collaborative editing, review, and approval of narratives before publication in the corresponding repository. It is based on [git-clerk](https://github.com/EOX-A/git-clerk)—an open-source content management system built on Git workflows with a user-friendly file-editing interface.

Markdown files are organized into story blocks and, when needed, further divided into individual steps within each section. Rendered stories can be displayed in either a paginated format or scrollytelling mode.

A [demo story](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/story/elements-eox-storytelling--markdown-with-editor) demonstrates most of the current functionality.

A notable feature is the built-in integration with the [eox-map element](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-eox-map--docs), which enables interactive map tours that smoothly transition between areas or layers as users scroll through the story. 

[eox-chart-element](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-eox-chart--docs) can be included in the stories as well.
