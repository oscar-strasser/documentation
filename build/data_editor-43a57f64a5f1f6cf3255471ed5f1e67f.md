# Data Editor

The Data Editor application provides a traceable review and approval path for collection configurations before data is published to the configured STAC catalog. This STAC catalog is used in the [Publishing Dashboard](publishing_dashboard.md) which is based on [eodash](https://eodash.org).

It is based on [git-clerk](https://github.com/EOX-A/git-clerk) - Open-Source Content Management System based on Git workflows with a friendly file-editing GUI.

It enables workspace owners to describe their datasets using simple forms, validate them against JSON schema definitions, and commit them via Git-based sessions.

## Supported data types
Currently supported data (resource) types are: 

* Raw sources:
  * COG source
  * GeoJSON source
  * FlatGeobuf source
* SentinelHub
* SentinelHub WMS
* GeoDB
* GeoDB Vector Tile
* WMS
* VEDA - Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis
* XCube Server
* Copernicus Marine Data Store WMTS


A list of all supported resources is kept up to date on the [eodash wiki](https://github.com/eodash/eodash_catalog/wiki/Resource), so please visit this site as well.



## Required information

All required fields are marked in the Data Editor. More information about each of the fields is available on the [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/eodash/eodash_catalog/wiki)

## Overview of the process

Generally, to include a supported type of EO collection in an eodash deployment within EOxHub, the steps are as follows:

- Start a new `session` in the Data Editor and create a new collection configuration file.
- Fill in the metadata fields, which are split into thematic groups. Filling in the [Resource](https://github.com/eodash/eodash_catalog/wiki/Resource) field is particularly important for visualizing the data on the web map.
- For raw data and client-only rendering (GeoJSON, FlatGeobuf, or GeoTIFF as direct access), eodash supports an [OpenLayers flat style](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_flat.html). More information on styling can be [found here](https://eodash.org/styling.html#vector-styling).
- The eodash project offers [eodash-style-editor](https://github.com/eodash/eodash-style-editor) for editing flat style definitions and updating the visualization in real time as the definition changes.
- To define interactions for the user (e.g. modify the style within the eodash app), the style can be extended with variables, combined with [JSON Form definition](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-eox-jsonform--docs).
- After confirming the updates in the layer live preview panel and approving the corresponding Data Editor session (GitHub pull request), the changes can be merged into the production catalog.
