# File Browser

The **File Browser** is a web-based file management application integrated into the EOxHub Workspace, enabling users to efficiently upload, organize, and manage geospatial data assets. Built upon the [Versioneer Tech Package-R](https://github.com/versioneer-tech/package-r), it offers a streamlined interface for interacting with datasets within the workspace.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clean, intuitive interface for navigating and managing files.
- **Folder Structure Management**: Allows users to create, rename, and organize folders to structure their data effectively.
- **File Operations**: Supports standard file operations such as upload, download, delete, and move, facilitating efficient data management.
- **Metadata Integration**: Enables the association of metadata with files, enhancing data discoverability and context.



## Public Access System

EOxHub Workspace employs a public access system to facilitate sharing and accessing datasets:

- **Public Folder**: Files placed in the `public` directory are accessible via permanent public URLs, allowing for easy sharing and integration into other applications e.g. [Data Editor](data_editor).
- **Shareable Links**: Users can generate shareable links for specific files or folders, providing controlled access to external collaborators.
- **Access Control**: All areas within the File Browser are restricted to be accessed only by users of the workspace. Data in the `public` folder is openly accessible. By using the creation of shareable links other files can be made accessible to external people.
